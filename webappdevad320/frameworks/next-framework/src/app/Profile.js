        <h2>Professional life</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Bradley Charles and I am taking application development at <strong><em>North Seattle College</em></strong>. I am transfering from <strong><em>Big Sandy Community and Technical College</em></strong>, which is located in Eastern Kentucky, where I was also taking programming classes. My goal at NSC is to learn the skills I need to start my career in either a IT or similar field that lets me use my knowledge and understanding in technology to solve problems. I currently work as a computer and cell phone repair technition which allows me to use my skills in a very hands-on manner and I am excited to be adding to that by taking this class.

        <h2>Personal life</h2>
        <p>
            I grew up in the Appalachian mountains and am very fond of hiking, swimming and camping when the weather is nice. When I am not getting outside I am usually playing games with my wife and friends either online or in person. We enjoy playing boardgames as well as card games. We recently started playing a tabletop RPG called Legend of the Five Rings. I like to read books and watch television. Sci-fi and fantasy are among my favorite genres.
